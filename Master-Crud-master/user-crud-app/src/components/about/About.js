                Batman is a superhero appearing in American comic books
                published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob
                Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of
                the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC
                Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a
                wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who
                resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him
                swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder
                of his parents Thomas and Martha, a vendetta tempered with the
                ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and
                intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the
                Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators
                accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his
                sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth, James
                Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler,
                Two-Face, and his archenemy the Joker.

                Wonder Woman is a superheroine appearing in American comic books
                published by DC Comics. The character is a founding member of
                the Justice League. The character first appeared in All Star
                Comics #8 published October 21, 1941 with her first feature in
                Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942. The Wonder Woman title has
                been published by DC Comics almost continuously ever since. In
                her homeland, the island nation of Themyscira, her official
                title is Princess Diana of Themyscira. When blending into the
                society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her
                civilian identity Diana Prince. Wonder Woman was created by the
                American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston (pen
                name: Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter. Marston's
                wife, Elizabeth, and their life partner, Olive Byrne, are
                credited as being his inspiration for the character's
                appearance.
